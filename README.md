Hi,
I developed the user management system with user / admin roles. 
As per requirements, user can only update profile whereas, Admin has the access to view the user list, add user, update user & delete user.
The framework in which I develop the project is Laravel.
Middlewares are implemented to specify the roles & permisions.

I am attaching a demo video for the whole process too.

Th credentials to login are:

User login:
email: user@gmail.com
password: JohnDoe

Admin login:
email: admin@gmail.com
password: JohnDoe
